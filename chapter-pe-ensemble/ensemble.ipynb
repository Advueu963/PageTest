    "Another import class of methods is *ensemble learning*, such as bagging or boosting, which are especially popular in machine learning due to their ability to improve accuracy of (point) predictions. \n",
    "Since such methods produce a (large) set of predictors $h_1, \\ldots, h_M$ instead of a single hypothesis, it is tempting to produce probability estimates following basic frequentist principles. In the simplest case (of classification), each prediction $h_i(\\vec{x})$ can be interpreted as a \"vote\" in favor of a class $y \\in \\mathcal{Y}$, and probabilities can be estimated by relative frequencies\\,---\\,needless to say, probabilities constructed in this way tend to be biased and are not necessarily well calibrated. Especially important in this field are tree-based methods such as random forests ({cite:t}`brei_rf01,krup_pe14`).  \n",
