    "Training probabilistic predictors is typically accomplished by minimizing suitable loss functions, i.e., loss functions that enforce ``correct'' (conditional) probabilities as predictions. In this regard, proper scoring rules \\citep{gnei_sp05} play an important role, including the log-loss as a well-known special case. Sometimes, however, estimates are also obtained in a very simple way, following basic frequentist techniques for probability estimation, like in Na\\\"ive Bayes or nearest neighbor classification. \n"

    "The predictions delivered by corresponding methods are at best ``pseudo-probabilities'' that are often not very accurate. Besides, there are many methods that deliver natural scores, intuitively expressing a degree of confidence (like the distance from the separating hyperplane in support vector machines), but which do not immediately qualify as probabilities either. The idea of \\emph{scaling} or \\emph{calibration methods} is to turn such scores into proper, well-calibrated probabilities, that is, to learn a mapping from scores to the unit interval that can be applied to the output of a predictor as a kind of post-processing step \\citep{flac_cc17}. Examples of such methods include binning \\citep{zadr_oc01}, isotonic regression \\citep{zadr_tc02}, logistic scaling \\citep{Pla00} and improvements thereof \\citep{kull_bc17}, as well as the use of Venn predictors \\citep{joha_vp18}. Calibration is still a topic of ongoing research. \n"

    "Another import class of methods is \\emph{ensemble learning}, such as bagging or boosting, which are especially popular in machine learning due to their ability to improve accuracy of (point) predictions. \n",
    "Since such methods produce a (large) set of predictors $h_1, \\ldots, h_M$ instead of a single hypothesis, it is tempting to produce probability estimates following basic frequentist principles. In the simplest case (of classification), each prediction $h_i(\\vec{x})$ can be interpreted as a ``vote'' in favor of a class $y \\in \\mathcal{Y}$, and probabilities can be estimated by relative frequencies\\,---\\,needless to say, probabilities constructed in this way tend to be biased and are not necessarily well calibrated. Especially important in this field are tree-based methods such as random forests \\citep{brei_rf01,krup_pe14}.  "

    "Obviously, while standard probability estimation is a viable approach to representing uncertainty in a prediction, there is no explicit distinction between different types of uncertainty. Methods falling into this category are mostly concerned with the aleatoric part of the overall uncertainty.\\footnote{Yet, as will be seen later on, one way to go beyond mere aleatoric uncertainty is to combine the above methods, for example learning ensembles of probabilistic predictors (cf.\\ Section \\ref{sec:m1}).}  \n"
