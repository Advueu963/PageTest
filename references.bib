              into account. "High-level" individuals use qualitative as well as quantitative
              information, whereas "low-level" prefer only qualitative information. A simulation of
              this two konds of individuals, using a production rule system, is presented, which

              instance models, case based models, connectionism.

              between the methods of reasoning is mentioned.}

              motion is based on a theory, which each individual generates for himself, or if a
              prototype-approach is appropriate. It is argued, that the theory approach generally
              is based on rules, whereas the prototype-appoach doesn't distinguish between
              theory and observation. Experminatal results showed the prototype approch in this case
              to be more likely, especially because individuals showed inconsistencies in their
              reasoning, which should not occur if a gerneral theory was responsible.}

  abstract  = {Conformal prediction (CP) is an attractive
               theoretical framework for estimating the
               uncertainties of any predictive algorithms as its
               methodology is general and systematic with few
               assumptions. CP methods can be abstracted into
               building blocks that can be deployed on any type of
               data, model, or task. In this work, we contribute to
               the wide diffusion of the CP framework by developing
               the library MAPIE1 that implements such principles
               and can address seamlessly different tasks
               (e.g. classification, regression, time-series) and
               in different settings (split and
               cross-conformal). All these concepts are under a
               common umbrella with an emphasis on readability,
               transparency, and reliability, hence supporting the
               principles of trustworthy AI. An original feature of
               MAPIE is to offer the possibility of designing
               tailored-made non-conformity scores in particular
               p-normalized residual non-conformal scores that can
               be defined to account for asymmetric errors. We show
               theoretically the marginal coverage guarantee in
               several settings. We highlight through applications
               the interest of choosing different non-conformity
               scores for tabular data when considering local
               coverage.}

The boundary of a dataset can be used to detect novel data or outliers. We will present the Support Vector Data Description (SVDD) which is inspired by the Support Vector Classifier. It obtains a spherically shaped boundary around a dataset and analogous to the Support Vector Classifier it can be made flexible by using other kernel functions. The method is made robust against outliers in the training set and is capable of tightening the description by using negative examples. We show characteristics of the Support Vector Data Descriptions using artificial and real data.},

This is especially true for topics covering computational tools and data science, as both are challenging to incorporate in the standard curriculum. These atypical learning environments offer new opportunities for teaching, particularly when it comes to combining conceptual knowledge with hands-on experience/expertise with methods and skills. Advances in cloud computing and containerized environments provide an attractive opportunity to improve the effciency and ease with which students can learn. This manuscript details recent advances towards using commonly-Available cloud computing services and advanced cyberinfrastructure support for improving the learning experience in bootcamp-style events. We cover the benets (and challenges) of using a server hosted remotely instead of relying on student laptops, discuss the technology that was used in order to make this possible, and give suggestions for how others could implement and improve upon this model for pedagogy and reproducibility.},

	abstract = {© 2017 Holdgraf, Rieger, Micheli, Martin, Knight and Theunissen. Cognitive neuroscience has seen rapid growth in the size and complexity of data recorded from the human brain as well as in the computational tools available to analyze this data. This data explosion has resulted in an increased use of multivariate, model-based methods for asking neuroscience questions, allowing scientists to investigate multiple hypotheses with a single dataset, to use complex, time-varying stimuli, and to study the human brain under more naturalistic conditions. These tools come in the form of “Encoding” models, in which stimulus features are used to model brain activity, and “Decoding” models, in which neural features are used to generated a stimulus output. Here we review the current state of encoding and decoding models in cognitive electrophysiology and provide a practical guide toward conducting experiments and analyses in this emerging field. Our examples focus on using linear models in the study of human language and audition. We show how to calculate auditory receptive fields from natural sounds as well as how to decode neural recordings to predict speech. The paper {aim}s to be a useful tutorial to these approaches, and a practical introduction to using machine learning and applied statistics to build models of neural activity. The data analytic approaches we discuss may also be applied to other sensory modalities, motor systems, and cognitive systems, and we cover some examples in these areas. In addition, a collection of Jupyter notebooks is publicly available as a complement to the material covered in this paper, providing code examples and tutorials for predictive modeling in python. The {aim}is to provide a practical understanding of predictivemodeling of human brain data and to propose best-practices in conducting these analyses.},
